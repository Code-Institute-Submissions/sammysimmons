Interactive Hangman Game
This Game is for educational purposes only. No styling templates have been used for this project. I chose hangman as this was one of my favourite games of my childhood.

# Technologies

1.JavaScript
2.HTML
3.CSS
4.Jquery

# UX & UI

The design for this game is based around a coding theme i have designed and tailored to suit this game. By generating a Word which isnt visable, the letter buttons them become interactive, for the user to guess the letters in the word.

The game will also give you the option to restart once you have used all your lives up.

## How to Play

### both desktop and mobile friendly especially for touchscreen
Press Play game on the start up page, this automatically generated a hidden word for you to uncover, but dont forget once all your lives are up its game over.


# Features

Each word is generated by random.
Once you have selected a letter this letter then disables, so you cannot reselect that letter.

you can play with any device, by clicking the button elements, as most devices are now touch screen i have designed that with this in mind.

## Testing

All tests have been run manually through the console in google chrome. I have also utilising the debugger; on the lines the errors are appearing in the try and break down these errors further.

issue 01
was getting the alphabet buttons to interact, i firstly built these into the html, but then after researching discovered this is not classed as best practice as you will have to duplicate instructions across each button which can get a little messy.
